b-tree
======

b-tree is a B+ Tree implementation in Scala. b-tree is designed to be both generic (type parameters for keys and values, and an abstract type for node references) and general (doesn't care how the tree is stored). An extending class needs to implement a number of simple methods and node type that provide storage abstraction.
